The following sequence was compiled by watching scenes in the show where the gaunltlet was visible.
This is by no means 100% screen accurate, but I have tried my best to make it as close to the show possible.
This sequence is subject to change as we get higher resolution reference images and more merchandise. 
The code also includes replacement lines for the bitmap images. The included images are scaled to fit the 1.3" Beskar display.
Simply drag and drop the code.py file onto the board and click on "Replace the File in the Destination".
If you get a memory allocation error, simply press on the "Reset" button on the board. 
Keep in mind that these boards have very limited flash memory and both images might not work in conjuction.
